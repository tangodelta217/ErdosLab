# Status

## Implemented today
- Lean 4 + mathlib project scaffold (lakefile, toolchain, basic module).
- Policy-as-code checks for problem status and evidence.
- Local checks (no sorry/admit/axiom/unsafe) and CI workflow.
- Single-problem workflow with problems/TEMPLATE and problems/ACTIVE.
- Reproducibility via Docker and local instructions.
- GitHub hygiene (PR template, issue templates, CODEOWNERS).

## Missing to start a real problem
- Populate problems/ACTIVE with a real statement and definitions.
- Fill in frozen statement, variants, and writeup.
- Add evidence (Lean file or certificate) for solved/disproved claims.
- Document verification policy in docs/VERIFICATION_POLICY.md.
