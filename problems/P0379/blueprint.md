## Goal theorem
- For $S(n)$ defined in the frozen statement, show $\limsup S(n)=\infty$.

## Lemmas (expected)
1) (mathlib) Basic facts about binomial coefficients, divisibility, and $p$-adic valuation.
2) (needs proof) Kummer-style characterization of $v_p(\binom{n}{k})$ via base-$p$ carries.
3) (needs proof) Construction of $n$ where every $1 \le k < n$ yields large $v_p(\binom{n}{k})$ for some prime $p$.
4) (needs proof) Translate the construction into a lower bound on $S(n)$ and extract $\limsup S(n)=\infty$.

## Notes
- Lemmas 2–4 may already exist in the external Lean formalization; import if compatible.
